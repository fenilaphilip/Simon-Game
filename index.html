      The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the
      series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to
      reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the
      Simon. In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes
      increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more
      solicited.
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly
          producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.
        </li>
        <li>The player has to press the same key.</li>
        <li>
          Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again
          randomly.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the
          game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to
          the test.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an
          endless game!
        </li>
      </ol>
